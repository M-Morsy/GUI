# GUI
A GUI application using Tkinter.
This is used with an interface with another verilog code.
The main purpose of this GUI is to act as a text-editor for assembly code, operate assembler code in the background, and produce three files:
1) Text Files conatins assembly code written
2) Binary File of the assembled code
3) Output File "this should be created by this code but filled with the verilog processor code, then read once again using this GUI code as an interface"

## Problems
1) Interface between Verilog code and this code failed and needs further investigation
# TBD
